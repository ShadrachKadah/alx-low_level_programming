What is Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation, is a programming technique that involves working with individual bits in a binary representation of data. In most computer systems, data is stored and manipulated as a sequence of binary digits, or bits, which can be either 0 or 1. Bit manipulation allows you to perform various operations on these individual bits, such as setting, clearing, flipping, or testing them to achieve specific tasks.

Common bitwise operations include:
	Bitwise AND (&):
	Bitwise OR (|):
	Bitwise XOR (^):
	Bitwise NOT (~):

Bit manipulation is often used in various programming tasks, including:
	Optimization:
	Data compression:
	Hardware control:
	Cryptography:
	Data structures:
Bit manipulation can be a powerful and efficient technique when used appropriately, but it requires a good understanding of binary representation and a careful approach to ensure correctness and maintainability in software development.
